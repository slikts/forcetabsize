#github-forcetabsize

This is a Chrome extension that attempts to normalize the indentation level 
in GitHub's code viewer. It assumes that the first indented non-comment line 
is at the first level of indentation and adjusts the indentation accordingly. 
It also applies `tab-size` CSS to the code viewer. The changes in tab size 
can be turned off with a page action button. The extenion doesn't affect 
any other workings of GitHub.
